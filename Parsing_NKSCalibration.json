Despite fine pressure measurement, it can withstand high pressure.GC16 For measuring gases and liquids\r\nBecause an evaporated type sensor with a stainless steel diaphragm is used, it is possible to measure gaseous and liquid substances. In addition, it features higher pressure resistance\r\nand prevents liquid pool.",
